# ReadyLayer — Product Messaging

## Product Positioning

### Name
**ReadyLayer**

### Category
**AI Code Readiness Platform**

### Tagline
**AI writes the code. ReadyLayer makes it production-ready.**

### One-Liner
ReadyLayer automatically reviews, tests, and documents AI-generated code before merge, ensuring production readiness without slowing down development.

## Value Pillars

ReadyLayer's value proposition is built on three core pillars, each mapped directly to a core module:

### 1. Review Guard — Trust Through Automated Review
**Pillar:** AI-aware code review that catches risks before merge

**Value Statement:**
AI-generated code moves fast, but quality gates can't. Review Guard analyzes every AI-touched diff for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and maintainability risks—then blocks or warns based on your team's thresholds.

**Key Benefits:**
- Security-first analysis of AI-generated patterns
- Quality gates that understand AI code context
- Inline PR comments with actionable fixes
- Zero false positives through context-aware rules

**Target Outcome:**
Teams merge AI code with confidence, knowing critical issues are caught automatically.

### 2. Test Engine — Coverage Without the Grind
**Pillar:** Automatic test generation and enforcement for AI-touched code

**Value Statement:**
AI writes features, but tests are still manual. Test Engine detects AI-touched files, generates tests using your existing framework, and enforces coverage thresholds—all before merge.

**Key Benefits:**
- Automatic test generation aligned with your test stack
- Coverage enforcement that adapts to AI-touched diffs
- CI integration that fails fast on missing tests
- Test placement rules that match your repo structure

**Target Outcome:**
Every AI-generated feature ships with tests, without developers writing boilerplate.

---

### 3. Doc Sync — Docs That Stay Current
**Pillar:** Automatic documentation and API spec generation from code changes

**Value Statement:**
Code changes, docs don't. Doc Sync parses code changes on merge, generates OpenAPI specs, updates documentation, and prevents drift—automatically.

**Key Benefits:**
- OpenAPI/spec generation from code changes
- Merge-triggered documentation updates
- Artifact storage and publishing
- Drift prevention that flags outdated docs

**Target Outcome:**
Documentation and API specs stay in sync with code, without manual maintenance.

## Positioning Against Alternatives

### vs. Traditional Code Review Tools (CodeRabbit, Reviewable)
**Differentiator:** AI-aware analysis that understands AI-generated patterns, not just generic code quality.

### vs. Test Generation Tools (Codium, TestGen)
**Differentiator:** Integrated into PR workflow, enforces coverage gates, and works with your existing test stack.

### vs. Documentation Tools (Swagger, Postman)
**Differentiator:** Automatic generation from code changes, merge-triggered updates, and drift prevention.

### vs. AI Code Assistants (Copilot, Cursor)
**Differentiator:** ReadyLayer sits *after* AI generation, ensuring production readiness—complements, doesn't compete.

## Core Promise Summary

**Before ReadyLayer:**
- AI generates code → Manual review → Manual tests → Manual docs → Merge (maybe)

**With ReadyLayer:**
- AI generates code → ReadyLayer reviews, tests, documents → Merge (with confidence)

**Mental Model:**
ReadyLayer is a mandatory readiness layer, not a developer tool. It's the quality gate that makes AI-generated code production-ready.
