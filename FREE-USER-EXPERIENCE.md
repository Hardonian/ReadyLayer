## FREE USER RETENTION STRATEGY

### Strategy 1: Create Anxiety (Not Break)
**Approach:** Free tier should feel risky over time, not break  
**Implementation:**
- High issues warn (not block) → Creates anxiety
- No pattern detection → Creates anxiety
- Limited history → Creates anxiety
- AI budget limit → Creates anxiety

**Result:** Users feel anxious, upgrade to paid tier

### Strategy 2: Prove Value First
**Approach:** Free tier proves value (critical issues blocked)  
**Implementation:**
- Critical issues always blocked → Proves value
- Basic review automation → Proves value
- Limited AI analysis → Proves value

**Result:** Users see value, want more (upgrade)

### Strategy 3: Gradual Value Accumulation
**Approach:** Value accumulates over time, but limited  
**Implementation:**
- 30-day history → Limited value accumulation
- No pattern detection → No value accumulation
- No escalation → No value accumulation

**Result:** Users see value, but want more (upgrade)

## FREE USER CHURN RISK

### High Churn Risk (Month 2-3)
**Why:** Free tier feels risky, no upgrade  
**Mitigation:** 
- Show upgrade value (prevent high issue incidents)
- Show pattern detection value (prevent recurring issues)
- Show escalation value (adapt enforcement)

### Low Churn Risk (Week 1-2)
**Why:** Free tier proves value, users happy  
**Mitigation:**
- Continue proving value (critical issues blocked)
- Show upgrade path (Growth tier benefits)
- Create anxiety gradually (not immediately)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Free users feel:**
- Week 1-2: ✅ Relieved, confident, grateful
- Week 3-4: ⚠️ Concerned, frustrated, anxious
- Month 2-3: 😟 Anxious, uncertain, risky
- Month 4+: 💡 Decisive, clear, motivated (upgrade)

**Free tier creates anxiety over time, not breaks immediately.**

**Result:** Free users upgrade to paid tier when anxiety peaks (Month 2-4).
