## Problem Section

### Headline
**AI made you faster. But can you trust what's getting merged?**

### Problem Points
- **AI common errors:** Context slips, code drift, and hallucinated dependencies slip through
- **Security risks:** AI-generated code introduces vulnerabilities that generic tools miss
- **Missing tests:** AI writes features, but tests are still manual—coverage drops
- **Documentation drift:** Code changes, docs don't—API specs fall behind
- **Lack of transparency:** No visibility into what was checked and why
- **Workflow disruption:** Tools that replace existing processes create friction

### Statistics
- 73% of developers use AI code generation tools
- 42% report security concerns with AI-generated code
- 58% say test coverage drops with AI-generated code
- 67% struggle to keep documentation in sync

### Headline
**ReadyLayer: Verifiable Assurance That Integrates With Your Workflow**

### Three Pillars

#### 1. Review Guard — Trust Through Automated Review
**Headline:** AI-aware code review that catches risks before merge

**Description:**
Review Guard integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and your CI/CD. It adds specialized checks that catch AI common errors—context slips, code drift, hallucinated dependencies, security vulnerabilities—without replacing your workflow. Every check is transparent and traceable.

**Features:**
- Specialized AI error detection (context slips, drift, hallucinations)
- Security-first analysis (SQL injection, XSS, secrets, etc.)
- Threat detection and analytics that inform each other
- Inline PR comments with actionable fixes
- Works alongside your existing review process
- Verifiable assurance: every check is traceable

#### 2. Test Engine — Coverage Without the Grind
**Headline:** Automatic test generation and enforcement for AI-touched code

**Description:**
Test Engine detects AI-touched files, generates tests using your existing framework, and enforces coverage thresholds—all before merge.

**Features:**
- Automatic test generation aligned with your test stack
- Coverage enforcement that adapts to AI-touched diffs
- CI integration that fails fast on missing tests
- Test placement rules that match your repo structure

#### 3. Doc Sync — Docs That Stay Current
**Headline:** Automatic documentation and API spec generation from code changes

**Description:**
Doc Sync parses code changes on merge, generates OpenAPI specs, updates documentation, and prevents drift—automatically.

**Features:**
- OpenAPI/spec generation from code changes
- Merge-triggered documentation updates
- Artifact storage and publishing
- Drift prevention that flags outdated docs

**Visual:** Screenshot of OpenAPI spec and updated docs
