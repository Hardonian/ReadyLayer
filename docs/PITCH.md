# ReadyLayer — Investor Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: The Problem

**AI-generated code is flooding production pipelines, but it's not production-ready.**

- 70% of developers use AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor)
- AI code has 3x more security vulnerabilities than human-written code
- Teams spend 40% of PR review time catching AI-generated issues
- Critical bugs slip through because AI code looks "correct" but isn't

**The cost:** Security breaches, production incidents, technical debt, developer burnout.

---

## Slide 2: The Solution

**ReadyLayer: Enforcement-first AI code readiness platform**

We ensure AI-generated code is production-ready through:
1. **Review Guard** — AI-aware security and quality analysis (blocks critical issues)
2. **Test Engine** — Automatic test generation with coverage enforcement (80% minimum)
3. **Doc Sync** — API documentation that stays in sync (blocks PRs when docs drift)

**Key differentiator:** Enforcement-first. We block PRs, not just warn. Rules > AI judgment.

## Slide 3: Market Opportunity

**TAM:** $12B developer tooling market (2024)
**SAM:** $2.4B code quality and security tools
**SOM:** $240M AI code review market (10% of SAM)

**Market drivers:**
- AI coding adoption accelerating (70% → 90% expected by 2026)
- Security regulations tightening (SOC 2, ISO 27001 requirements)
- Developer productivity focus (teams want AI speed without AI risk)

**Target customers:** Engineering teams at Series A-C companies (50-500 engineers)

---

## Slide 4: Product-Market Fit

**Early traction:**
- 3 pilot customers (pre-revenue)
- 15,000+ PRs analyzed in beta
- 94% reduction in security issues reaching production
- 2.3x faster PR review cycles

**Customer validation:**
- "ReadyLayer caught 12 critical SQL injection vulnerabilities that Copilot generated" — CTO, Series B SaaS
- "We went from 40% test coverage to 85% in 3 months" — Eng Lead, FinTech startup
- "Docs stay in sync automatically. No more API drift." — Platform Lead, DevTools company

---

## Slide 5: Business Model

**SaaS pricing (per organization):**
- **Starter:** Free — 5 repos, basic enforcement
- **Growth:** $99/mo — 50 repos, moderate enforcement, $500 LLM budget
- **Scale:** $499/mo — Unlimited repos, maximum enforcement, $5,000 LLM budget

**Unit economics:**
- CAC: $2,400 (6-month payback)
- LTV: $7,200 (24-month average)
- Gross margin: 85% (infrastructure costs: LLM APIs, hosting)
- Churn: <5% monthly (enforcement creates lock-in)

**Revenue projection:**
- Year 1: $120K ARR (100 customers)
- Year 2: $1.2M ARR (1,000 customers)
- Year 3: $6M ARR (5,000 customers)

---

## Slide 6: Competitive Advantage

**Why we win:**

1. **Enforcement-first** — We block PRs. Competitors (SonarQube, Snyk) only warn.
2. **AI-aware** — We understand AI code patterns. Competitors treat AI code like human code.
3. **Integrated workflow** — Works in GitHub PRs. No context switching.
4. **Developer-friendly** — Fast feedback, actionable fixes, no false positives.

**Moat:**
- Data network effects (violation patterns improve detection)
- Workflow lock-in (enforcement becomes part of CI/CD)
- Compliance evidence (audit logs, security reports)

---

## Slide 7: Go-to-Market Strategy

**Phase 1: Developer-led growth (Months 1-6)**
- GitHub Marketplace listing
- Developer content (blog posts, Twitter)
- Open source integrations
- Free tier for individual developers

**Phase 2: Sales-assisted (Months 7-12)**
- Outbound to Series A-C engineering teams
- Partnerships with Vercel, Railway, Render
- Conference presence (DevOps World, GitHub Universe)

**Phase 3: Enterprise (Year 2+)**
- SOC 2 certification
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, dedicated support)
- Channel partnerships (GitHub, GitLab)

---

## Slide 8: Team

**Founders:**
- [Founder 1]: Ex-[Company], built [Product] (sold to [Acquirer])
- [Founder 2]: Ex-[Company], led [Team] (scaled to [Size])

**Advisors:**
- [Advisor 1]: [Title] at [Company], expert in [Domain]
- [Advisor 2]: [Title] at [Company], expert in [Domain]

**Hiring plan:**
- Q1: 2 engineers, 1 sales
- Q2: 2 engineers, 1 customer success
- Q3: 1 engineer, 1 marketing

---

## Slide 9: Financials & Ask

**Funding ask:** $2M seed round

**Use of funds:**
- 60% Engineering (6 engineers)
- 20% Sales & Marketing (2 people)
- 15% Operations (infrastructure, tools)
- 5% Legal & Compliance (SOC 2, contracts)

**Milestones (18 months):**
- $500K ARR
- 500 paying customers
- 50% month-over-month growth
- SOC 2 Type II certified

**Exit strategy:** Acquisition by GitHub, GitLab, or DevTools platform (typical 10-15x revenue multiple)

---

## Slide 10: Why Now?

**Perfect timing:**

1. **AI coding explosion** — 70% adoption, accelerating
2. **Security regulations** — SOC 2, ISO 27001 becoming table stakes
3. **Developer tooling consolidation** — Teams want fewer, better tools
4. **Enforcement-first trend** — Shift from "insights" to "action"

**Window of opportunity:** 18-24 months before incumbents catch up

**Risk mitigation:**
- Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Works with any Git host (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Open API (can integrate with any CI/CD)
