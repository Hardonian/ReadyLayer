## AI USAGE PATTERNS

### Where AI is Used
1. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - Quick feature implementation
   - MVP development
   - Proof of concept code
   - Client demos

2. **Client Project Work**
   - Implementing client requirements
   - Fixing bugs quickly
   - Adding features to existing codebases
   - Writing tests for client code

3. **Code Reuse Across Projects**
   - Adapting code from one project to another
   - Creating reusable components
   - Generating boilerplate
   - Quick refactoring

### How AI Suggestions Enter Codebase
- **Primary:** Rapid copy-paste from AI tools
- **Secondary:** Cursor/Copilot for speed
- **Tertiary:** Bulk code generation for features

### Where AI Output is Trusted Too Much
1. **Client Requirements** - AI code may not meet actual client needs
2. **Security** - Quick implementation may skip security considerations
3. **Integration** - AI code may not integrate well with client systems
4. **Maintenance** - AI code may create future maintenance burden

### Where AI Output Creates Follow-On Work
1. **Client Revisions** - Need to fix AI code that doesn't meet requirements
2. **Security Fixes** - Need to add security after the fact
3. **Integration Issues** - Need to fix integration problems
4. **Technical Debt** - Need to refactor AI code later

### Where AI Output Creates Pre-Deploy Anxiety
1. **Client Satisfaction** - "Will this meet client expectations?"
2. **Security** - "Did I introduce a vulnerability?"
3. **Integration** - "Will this work with client's systems?"
4. **Maintenance** - "Will I need to fix this later?"

## PAIN EVENTS (Agency/Freelancer-Specific)

### CRITICAL PAIN EVENTS

#### 1. Client Security Breaches
**Event:** AI code introduces security vulnerability in client project  
**Root Cause:** Speed-focused development skips security  
**Impact:** Client data breach, legal liability, reputation damage, lost clients  
**Detection Gap:** No security review in fast-paced workflow  
**Frequency:** Low but catastrophic (annually)

#### 2. Client Requirements Mismatch
**Event:** AI code doesn't actually meet client requirements  
**Root Cause:** AI generates code based on incomplete understanding  
**Impact:** Client dissatisfaction, rework, billing disputes, reputation damage  
**Detection Gap:** No requirement validation  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

#### 3. Integration Failures
**Event:** AI code doesn't integrate with client's existing systems  
**Root Cause:** AI doesn't understand client's architecture  
**Impact:** Delayed delivery, client frustration, rework, billing issues  
**Detection Gap:** No integration validation  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

### HIGH SEVERITY PAIN EVENTS

#### 4. Technical Debt Accumulation
**Event:** AI code creates debt that needs fixing later (unbilled)  
**Root Cause:** Quick implementation prioritizes speed over quality  
**Impact:** Unpaid rework, client complaints, reputation damage  
**Detection Gap:** No debt tracking  
**Frequency:** High (ongoing)

#### 5. Client Codebase Contamination
**Event:** AI code introduces patterns/styles that don't match client codebase  
**Root Cause:** AI doesn't understand client's codebase standards  
**Impact:** Client complaints, rework, maintenance burden  
**Detection Gap:** No codebase consistency checking  
**Frequency:** High (weekly)

#### 6. Billing Disputes
**Event:** Client disputes billing due to AI code quality issues  
**Root Cause:** AI code needs fixes that client expects to be included  
**Impact:** Revenue loss, client relationship damage  
**Detection Gap:** No quality validation before delivery  
**Frequency:** Medium (quarterly)

### MEDIUM SEVERITY PAIN EVENTS

#### 7. Maintenance Burden
**Event:** AI code requires ongoing maintenance (unbilled)  
**Root Cause:** AI code isn't maintainable long-term  
**Impact:** Unpaid support time, client frustration  
**Detection Gap:** No maintainability analysis  
**Frequency:** High (ongoing)

#### 8. Performance Issues
**Event:** AI code works but performs poorly in production  
**Root Cause:** AI doesn't optimize for performance  
**Impact:** Client complaints, rework  
**Detection Gap:** No performance analysis  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)
