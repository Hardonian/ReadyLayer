## AI USAGE PATTERNS

### Where AI is Used
1. **Learning & Exploration**
   - Understanding new frameworks/libraries
   - Generating code examples
   - Asking "how do I..." questions
   - Exploring different approaches

2. **Daily Coding Tasks**
   - Implementing features from tickets
   - Fixing bugs
   - Writing tests
   - Refactoring code

3. **Code Review Preparation**
   - Fixing linting errors before PR
   - Improving code based on feedback
   - Understanding best practices

### How AI Suggestions Enter Codebase
- **Primary:** Copy-paste from ChatGPT/Claude
- **Secondary:** Cursor/Copilot inline suggestions
- **Tertiary:** Bulk code generation for features

### Where AI Output is Trusted Too Much
1. **Best Practices** - AI suggests patterns that aren't actually best practices
2. **Security** - Junior dev doesn't recognize security issues in AI code
3. **Performance** - AI code works but isn't optimized
4. **Architecture** - AI suggests patterns that don't fit the codebase

### Where AI Output Creates Follow-On Work
1. **Code Review Feedback** - Senior devs need to explain why AI code is wrong
2. **Refactoring** - Need to fix AI code that doesn't follow patterns
3. **Learning Gaps** - Junior dev doesn't understand what AI generated
4. **Technical Debt** - AI code creates debt that needs cleanup

### Where AI Output Creates Pre-Deploy Anxiety
1. **Code Review** - "Will my PR get approved?"
2. **Mistakes** - "Did I introduce a bug?"
3. **Understanding** - "Do I understand what this code does?"
4. **Best Practices** - "Is this the right way to do it?"

## PAIN EVENTS (Junior Developer-Specific)

### CRITICAL PAIN EVENTS

#### 1. Security Vulnerabilities from Inexperience
**Event:** Junior dev uses AI code that introduces security vulnerability  
**Root Cause:** Doesn't recognize security anti-patterns  
**Impact:** Security breach, reputation damage, job risk  
**Detection Gap:** No security education in AI suggestions  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

#### 2. Code Review Rejection Rate
**Event:** High percentage of PRs rejected due to AI code issues  
**Root Cause:** AI code doesn't follow team patterns or best practices  
**Impact:** Slower career growth, frustration, imposter syndrome  
**Detection Gap:** No pre-review validation  
**Frequency:** High (weekly)

#### 3. Learning Anti-Patterns from AI
**Event:** Junior dev learns wrong patterns from AI code  
**Root Cause:** AI suggests patterns that aren't actually best practices  
**Impact:** Bad habits, slower learning, technical debt  
**Detection Gap:** No mentorship in AI suggestions  
**Frequency:** High (ongoing)

### HIGH SEVERITY PAIN EVENTS

#### 4. Performance Issues from Naive Code
**Event:** AI-generated code works but performs poorly  
**Root Cause:** Junior dev doesn't recognize performance issues  
**Impact:** Production performance problems, user complaints  
**Detection Gap:** No performance guidance  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

#### 5. Architecture Mismatches
**Event:** AI suggests patterns that don't fit codebase architecture  
**Root Cause:** Junior dev doesn't understand architecture  
**Impact:** Code doesn't fit, needs refactoring  
**Detection Gap:** No architecture-aware suggestions  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

#### 6. Test Coverage Gaps
