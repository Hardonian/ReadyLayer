## AI USAGE PATTERNS

### Where AI is Used
1. **Rapid Product Development**
   - Building MVP features quickly
   - Implementing investor-requested features
   - Quick iterations based on user feedback
   - Prototyping new ideas

2. **Team Scaling**
   - Onboarding new engineers quickly
   - Generating boilerplate for new features
   - Creating documentation for new hires
   - Standardizing patterns across team

3. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Quick fixes for production issues
   - Refactoring legacy code
   - Adding tests to existing code
   - Performance optimizations

### How AI Suggestions Enter Codebase
- **Primary:** Team members using AI tools for speed
- **Secondary:** Bulk code generation for features
- **Tertiary:** Quick fixes and patches

### Where AI Output is Trusted Too Much
1. **Production Code** - AI code goes straight to production without review
2. **Architecture** - AI suggests patterns that don't scale
3. **Security** - Speed-focused development skips security
4. **Testing** - AI code deployed without proper tests

### Where AI Output Creates Follow-On Work
1. **Production Issues** - Need to fix bugs in production
2. **Scaling Problems** - Need to refactor when scaling
3. **Security Fixes** - Need to add security after the fact
4. **Technical Debt** - Need to pay down debt later

### Where AI Output Creates Pre-Deploy Anxiety
1. **Production Stability** - "Will this break production?"
2. **Scaling** - "Will this work at scale?"
3. **Security** - "Did we introduce a vulnerability?"
4. **Investor Demos** - "Will this work for the demo?"

## PAIN EVENTS (Startup CTO-Specific)

### CRITICAL PAIN EVENTS

#### 1. Production Outages from AI Code
**Event:** AI code causes production outage during critical period  
**Root Cause:** Code deployed without proper testing/review  
**Impact:** Lost revenue, user churn, investor concerns, team stress  
**Detection Gap:** No pre-production validation  
**Frequency:** Medium (quarterly)

#### 2. Scaling Failures
**Event:** AI code works for MVP but fails at scale  
**Root Cause:** AI doesn't understand scaling requirements  
**Impact:** Performance issues, user complaints, forced rewrites  
**Detection Gap:** No scale-aware analysis  
**Frequency:** Medium (quarterly)

#### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
**Event:** AI code introduces security vulnerability  
**Root Cause:** Speed-focused development skips security  
**Impact:** Data breach, regulatory issues, reputation damage, investor concerns  
**Detection Gap:** No security review in fast workflow  
**Frequency:** Medium (quarterly)

### HIGH SEVERITY PAIN EVENTS

#### 4. Technical Debt Accumulation
**Event:** AI code creates debt that slows future development  
**Root Cause:** Quick implementation prioritizes speed  
**Impact:** Slower feature development, team frustration, investor pressure  
**Detection Gap:** No debt tracking  
**Frequency:** High (ongoing)

#### 5. Team Inconsistency
**Event:** Different team members using AI differently  
**Root Cause:** No standardized AI usage guidelines  
**Impact:** Codebase inconsistency, onboarding difficulty, maintenance burden  
**Detection Gap:** No consistency enforcement  
**Frequency:** High (ongoing)

#### 6. Investor Demo Failures
**Event:** AI code fails during investor demo  
**Root Cause:** Code deployed without proper testing  
**Impact:** Lost funding opportunity, reputation damage  
**Detection Gap:** No demo validation  
**Frequency:** Low but critical (annually)

### MEDIUM SEVERITY PAIN EVENTS

#### 7. Performance Issues
**Event:** AI code works but performs poorly  
**Root Cause:** AI doesn't optimize for performance  
**Impact:** User complaints, scaling issues  
**Detection Gap:** No performance analysis  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)

#### 8. Onboarding Difficulties
**Event:** New engineers struggle with AI-generated code  
**Root Cause:** AI code lacks documentation or is inconsistent  
**Impact:** Slower onboarding, team productivity loss  
**Detection Gap:** No documentation enforcement  
**Frequency:** Medium (monthly)
