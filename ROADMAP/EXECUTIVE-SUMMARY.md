- **Switching Cost:** HIGH

### Tier 2: Workflow Lock-In (Month 6-12)
- IDE deep integration (VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor)
- CI/CD deep integration (custom status checks, deployment gates)
- Team collaboration features
- **Switching Cost:** CRITICAL

### Tier 3: Customization Lock-In (Month 9-12)
- Custom rules engine
- Workflow customization
- White-label options
- **Switching Cost:** MEDIUM-HIGH

### Tier 4: Network Effects (Month 9-12)
